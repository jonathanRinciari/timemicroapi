            <li>I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a ntural language date(example: January 1, 2016)</li>
            <li>If it does, it return both the unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.</li>
            <li>If it does not contain a date or unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties</li>
